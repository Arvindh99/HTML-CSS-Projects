### HTML CSS Projects

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This repository contains a collection of beginner-level projects I created while learning HTML and CSS. These small projects helped me understand the fundamentals of front-end web development, such as layout, styling, positioning, and responsiveness.

Each project is simple and focused on specific concepts â€” great for anyone who is also learning or wants to review the basics.
